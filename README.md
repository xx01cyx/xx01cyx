### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yuanxin

- Iâ€™m currently a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, MCDS program.
- Iâ€™m interested in database systems, and I'm learning more about streaming databases via contributing to [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave).
- I'm exploring modern cloud systems and platforms like [Apache Openwhisk](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk).
